# 👋 Hello World in C — Project Report

## 🏷️ Project Title
**Hello World in C** — The Classic Beginner’s Program

## ⚡ Brief One Line Summary
A simple C program that prints “Hello, World!” to the screen — the foundational step in learning the C programming language.

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the basic structure of a **C program**, including the use of `#include`, the `main()` function, and the `printf()` statement.  
It serves as the **first exercise** for beginners to ensure that the compiler and development environment are correctly configured.

## ❓ Problem Statement
New programmers often need a **minimal working example** to confirm that:
- The C compiler is installed and configured.
- The user understands how to write, compile, and run C programs.
- The system can successfully execute a compiled binary.

## 🧩 Dataset
No external dataset is required — the program simply outputs a text message.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies
| Category | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| **Language** | C |
| **Compiler** | GCC / Clang / Turbo C / any standard C compiler |
| **Editor / IDE** | VS Code, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Terminal |
| **Platform** | Works on Windows, macOS, or Linux |

## 🔬 Methods

### Source Code:
```c
// hello_world.c
#include <stdio.h>  // Standard Input/Output library

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n"); // Print message to screen
    return 0; // Return success
}
```

### Explanation:
- `#include <stdio.h>` imports the **standard I/O library** that provides the `printf()` function.
- `int main()` is the **entry point** of every C program.
- `printf()` prints text to the console.
- `return 0;` indicates that the program executed successfully.

## 💡 Key Insights
- Introduces the **structure of a C program**.
- Teaches use of **header files**, **main()**, and **output functions**.
- Confirms compiler setup and basic syntax understanding.
- Demonstrates compilation and execution workflow.

## 📊 Output
When the program runs, the console displays:
```
Hello, World!
```

## ⚙️ How to Run this Project

### 1. Create the source file
Save the code as `hello_world.c`.

### 2. Compile the program
```bash
gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world
```

### 3. Run the executable
```bash
./hello_world
```

## 📈 Results & Conclusion
- The program compiles and runs successfully, printing **“Hello, World!”**.  
- Confirms that the **compiler and environment** are properly configured.  
- Serves as a foundation for learning C syntax, logic, and structure.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Take user input using `scanf()`.  
- Print dynamic messages (e.g., “Hello, Alice!”).  
- Extend the project to include loops, conditionals, and functions.  
- Experiment with formatting and escape sequences in `printf()`.
